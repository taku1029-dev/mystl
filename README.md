# mystl

This project aims to deepen understanding of basics of C programming by implementing simplified version of C standard library (stdlib). Starting with vector/linked list implementations based off of custom memory allocation instead of std::malloc, digging down into arena implementation and allocation strategies preferrably, standard data containers implementations are to be replaced with custom libraries. Additionally, essential algorithms are also to be implemented primarily using iterators.
